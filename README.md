# Deep

Deep is a Spotlight-style search experience for macOS. Today it focuses on a
fast, keyboard-first interface with a global hotkey and a clean, minimal panel.

Over time, Deep will evolve into a unified search layer across:

- Files and app content (fast local indexing)
- System data like apps, preferences, and settings
- User data sources (notes, messages, calendar, contacts) with permission
- Smarter ranking based on usage, recency, and intent

The goal is a search tool that feels instant, predictable, and deeply integrated
with how you actually work on your Mac.
